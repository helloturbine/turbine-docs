## Inventory Snapshots 
Inventory Snapshots are the method that Turbine uses to track inventory. On a regular cadence, we track lot codes (if applicable) and the on hand, available, and reserved counts for each available SKU. 

On the Stock page, you can find the date of the most recent inventory snapshot used for the current inventory count in the “Last Reconciled At” column.

## Nodes
Simply put, a node in Turbine is a place where inventory is stored. This can be a distribution center, fulfillment center, store, or headquarters. Turbine tracks the availability of inventory across nodes.
