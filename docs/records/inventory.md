# Inventory

Inventory refers to the stock of goods and materials that a business holds for the purpose of production, resale, or use in its operations. It includes raw materials, work-in-progress items, and finished goods. Inventory is a crucial aspect of supply chain management, and effective inventory control is essential for businesses to meet customer demand, minimize carrying costs, and maximize operational efficiency.

Turbine's inventory system extends beyond tracking, incorporating robust forecasting tools, such as demand forecasting, inventory planning, and reorder actioning, ensuring businesses can optimize their stock levels and stay agile in response to market demands.

Turbine uses the below terms to track and store inventory:

* **Incoming Inventory**: This includes inventory for which a Purchase Order has been cut, but the items have not yet been received.

* **On Hand**: This denotes the number of units currently located at a specific location.

* **Available**: The count of units that are ready for sale or use in work orders.

* **Reserved**: This indicates the number of units that have been ordered but not fulfilled, consumed, or made available for sale. Additionally, reserved inventory may include items set aside for future use, such as those associated with pre-orders, even if they are not physically on hand.

## Inventory Forecasting

Turbine's inventory forecasting is split into multiple parts: demand forecasting, inventory planning, and reorder actioning.

### Demand Forecasting

Our demand forecasting uses your historical sales data and advanced statistical modeling to predict the number of items to be sold per week for the next 6-12 months. The forecast is created at the per-SKU-per-channel level for each week.

As we often say, you know your business better than any statistical model, so we use this as as starting point and you can always adjust appropriately.

### Inventory Planning

We take the demand forecasting to help you know when you will be in or out of inventory based on on your existing inventory on hand and already ordered inventory (projected to be on hand).

Our forecasting bar uses fully saturated color to show you when items are in stock, a lightly saturated color to show you items projected to be in stock, and a grey color for when inventory is projected to be out of stock.

### Reorder Actioning

Based on BOMs and lead times configured in Turbine, we can use the inventory plan to help you know when you need to take action. The color of our forecasting bar can help you understand how close you are to the reorder by date, where red is less than a week, yellow is less than a month, and green is some other window.

## Inventory Snapshots

Inventory Snapshots are the method that Turbine uses to track inventory. On a regular cadence, we track lot codes (if applicable) and the on hand, available, and reserved counts for each available SKU.

On the Stock page, you can find the date of the most recent inventory snapshot used for the current inventory count in the “Last Reconciled At” column.
