# SKUs

Stock keeping units, informally known as SKUs, are codes used to keep track of individual inventory units and components. There are four main types of SKUs that Turbine uses to keep track of inventory and cut purchase orders:

**Vendor SKU**: The identifier that your supplier (or vendor) uses to identify a particular item.

**Internal/Remote SKU**: The identifier that you use internally to identify an item.

**Channel SKU**: The identifier that a particular sales channel uses to identify an item (e.g. Shopifyâ€™s Variant ID)

**Turbine SKU**: The ID that Turbine uses to tie all the different channels and vendor identifiers together. 

Turbine SKUs are created at a variant level, meaning that each Turbine SKU is mapped to a unique product. For example, an apparel company might sell a white T-shirt in sizes XS-XL. In Turbine, each of those products would have a unique Turbine SKU.
