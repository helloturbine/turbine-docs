# Receipts
Receipts are the second part of the three-way match reconciliation process. 

After a [purchase order](/records/purchase_orders) has been completed and the goods have been delivered to their destination, a receipt is provided by the warehouse. 

Ideally, the items and quantities listed should be exactly the same as the purchase order. Sometimes, the production levels are off. Error tolerance levels are usually +/- 5% of what was originally ordered. 

In the event an error is greater than what you specify, we'll raise an [exception](/exceptions/three-way-match) so you can figure out what went wrong.

## Linking Receipts to Nodes
For companies with multiple [nodes](/records/nodes), ensuring that inventory arrival is accurately marked at the appropriate location is essential.
When creating or uploading a receipt, you have the option to select the node where the shipment will be arriving. For warehouse users, node locations are automatically selected.
