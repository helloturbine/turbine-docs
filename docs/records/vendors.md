# Vendors

In Turbine, vendors or suppliers are critical entities that supply goods or services to businesses. They are registered on the platform with detailed information including their legal and "Doing Business As" (DBA) names, which help in distinguishing and authenticating various vendors. Additionally, Turbine collects contact details of individuals handling operations and Purchase Orders (POs), facilitating seamless communication and transaction management.

To streamline inventory management and avoid discrepancies, Turbine allows you to map your internal SKUs and components to the respective Vendor SKUs. This ensures a unified system where products are identified uniformly, irrespective of the varied nomenclatures used by different vendors. This not only helps in maintaining a structured database but also aids in efficient procurement processes, fostering a harmonious business relationship between companies and their vendors or suppliers.

## Add a Vendor to Turbine

From the [Vendors](https://app.helloturbine.com/app/vendors) Page in the upper right, select "New Vendor". 

In the "Create Vendor" modal, add the DBA (Doing Business As) & Legal Name for the vendor, as well as the default Incoterm that you use with that vendor. If you are not tracking Incoterms with the vendor, use the "NULLINCOTERM" option.

Add additional details, including contact, email addresses, and an address to the vendor. Hit "Update Vendor" save changes. 

## Add a SKU to the Vendor 

Many times, your supplier uses a specific term or code to refer to an item. We call that the [Vendor SKU](https://docs.helloturbine.com/records/skus).

To add a SKU to a Vendor, you'll need:
* the Internal SKU
* the Vendor SKU
* the Lead Time for the SKU
* the cost of that unit from your supplier

## Edit a Vendor

To edit a vendor, go to the Vendor details screen and make any changes. Make sure to SAVE changes.
