Important information such as the acknowledgment date and payment terms may not be readily available when creating a purchase order. Turbine allows you to easily edit POs to add this information later.

To start, click the "Edit PO" button in the top right corner of your screen. From there, you can add or modify important dates, Incoterms, and payment terms. Once you have made the necessary changes, remember to click "Save" below the Payment Terms field.

If you need to edit a line item on a PO, please reach out to your account manager to ensure you have the appropriate permissions and that this is enabled for your organization.
