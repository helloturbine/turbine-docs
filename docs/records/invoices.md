# Invoices
Invoices are the last part of the three-way match reconciliation process.

Invoices are sent from the manufacturer to the buyer, stating what goods were delivered, their cost, and the timeframe for payment.

This seems like a simple process, but issues with deliveries can be difficult to identify. This results in discrepancies between the three documents, and buyers can end up paying for things they didn't actually receive.

Turbine helps with this by raising exceptions when an invoice doesn't match other known information, helping you find and resolve problems faster.
