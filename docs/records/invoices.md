# Invoices
Invoices are the last part of the three-way match reconciliation process.

Invoices are sent from the manufacturer to the buyer, stating what goods were purchased, their cost, and the timeframe for payment.

## Editing an Invoice
- To start, click the Edit Invoice button on the top right hand side of the screen.
- Once the button is clicked, pencil icons will appear on the far right-hand side of each line item. You can then edit the specific line items you would like to change.
     - Editable fields are quantity, SKU, and price.
- **Important: Invoices are only editable for 48 hours after the initial creation time/date.**

If you need further assistance, please reach out to your account manager.
