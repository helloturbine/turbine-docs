# Nodes

Nodes denote the location of inventory items at any given time before being shipped to a customer. 

Examples of nodes are warehouses, company headquarters, or brick-and-mortar stores.

Turbine tracks the availability of inventory across nodes. You can use nodes to track inventory levels at each of your locations, and the flow of inventory items from one place in your shipping network to another.
