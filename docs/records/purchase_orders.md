# Purchase Orders
Purchase orders, also referred to as POs, are the first part of the three-way match reconciliation process.

We help you cut purchase orders and link created POs to receipts, invoices, and freight shipments. We also calculate the landed COGS of each purchase order, so you don't have to rely on outdated models. 

If a discrepancy occurs, we'll raise an [exception](/exceptions/three-way-match) so any issues can be identified and dealt with quickly.

## Creating a Purchase Order

Creating a purchase order in Turbine is streamlined and simple.

1. Start at the “Procure to Pay” tab in the navigation bar, then click “Purchase Orders.”
2. Next, click the “New PO” button on the top right-hand side of your screen.
3. Fill out the relevant information, including the PO ID number, Vendor, any Incoterms, and the Requested Ready date. The Transmitted Date is automatically set to the day you create the Purchase Order, although this can be changed. If you do not have a piece of information on hand, you can always edit the PO later.
4. To add line items to the Purchase Order, enter the price, quantity, Turbine SKU, and Node for each one. The SKU field is equipped with search, so you only have to remember the name of the item or your internal SKU code, and we’ll look up the Turbine SKU for you.
Once everything is filled out, hit the “Submit PO” button. That’s it!

For large Purchase Orders, line items can be submitted in bulk by using the “Bulk Mode” toggle switch at the bottom of the screen and following the listed instructions.

You can also cut multiple Purchase Orders at once by using the “Submit More” toggle switch towards the top of the screen, in the Purchase Order Details section.

## Editing a Purchase Order

Important information such as the acknowledgment date and payment terms may not be readily available when creating a purchase order. Turbine allows you to easily edit POs to add this information later.

To start, click the "Edit PO" button in the top right corner of your screen. From there, you can add or modify important dates, Incoterms, and payment terms. Once you have made the necessary changes, remember to click "Save" below the Payment Terms field.

If you need to edit a line item on a PO, please reach out to your account manager to ensure you have the appropriate permissions and that this is enabled for your organization.
