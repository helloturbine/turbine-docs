# Command Palette

Turbine has a command palette that can be brought up with the CMD+K or CTRL+K shortcut. 

## Navigation

The Command Palette can be used to navigate to any page in the app just by typing the name of the page. For example, "Purch.." will show up a suggestion of going to the Purchase Orders page.

## Search

The Command Palette also supports search across specific items using a "bang" shortcut. For example `!v` will search for vendors and `!s` will search across SKUs. 

The list of bank shortcuts that are supported are:

| Bang shortcut | Searches          |
|---------------|-------------------|
| !c            | Components        |
| !s            | SKUs              |
| !po           | Purchase Orders   |
| !v            | Vendors           |
| !r            | Receipts          |
| !fs           | Freight Shipments |
