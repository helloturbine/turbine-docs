# 2023-12-07

## Quickstart
* We've now added a [Quickstart](https://docs.helloturbine.com/turbine-quickstart) to the docs to make it easier to get started. 

## Home Page
* A brand-spankin-new home page is live! Share feedback with us. We can't wait to hear what you think!

## Nodes
* You can now add additional nodes (locations) in the UI directly. Go to the [Node](https://app.helloturbine.com/app/nodes) page and select "Create Node" in the upper right of the page. 

## Inventory
* Components are now alongside SKUs on the [Inventory](https://app.helloturbine.com/app/inventory) Page in alphabetical order. 

## Purchase Orders
* You can now cut a PO with a line item of $0. 
* We've renamed Source ID to PO Number on PO Details Page to make it clearer what we mean. 

## Receipts
* We've renamed Source ID to Receipt # on Receipt Creation Page to make it clearer what we mean.
