# 2023-08-16

## Design
- We've polished the UI to better align columns, and made things nice and compact on tables. Should be easier on your eyes.
- SKUs on the Stock page now link directly to the SKU details page! No more struggling to figure out what TUR-38932 is supposed to be.
- Payment statuses have fancy new badges (and they're color-coded, too!)

## Purchase Orders + Inventory
- Receiving a PO automatically creates new inventory on the Stock page. One less thing to worry about. 
- Upgrade alert! Our PO emailing feature now automatically updates the Transmitted Date and Acknowledged Date on a purchase order after a vendor accepts it via email. 
- Dive deep into the details: you can now precisely track how your inventory shifts after a customer places an order, right on the Order Details screen.
- We're also rolling out the ability to edit your purchase order line items, stay tuned...
