# 2023-11-09

This sprint we focused *mostly* on internal and admin tools to make it easier to continue to support you in your success. 

## Core improvements
* You can now add Anvyl credentials directly in the UI on the Setting page. No more sending us your creds. 
* New PO Improvements include a consolidated SKU/Component Pattern and improved vendor and vendor SKU handling. 
* No more accidental button clicks! You'll now see what Florian has named our "Lazy Confirmation" button that will require TWO clicks for dangerous activity. 
* More consistent capitalization across the Vendor, Vendor SKU, and PO workflows. You're welcome.

## Admin Tools
* New admin tool that allows us to reduce accidental duplicates of Vendor SKUs. 
* New admin tool to delete receipts no matter where they came from. 
* New admin tool to edit and merge nodes. Use with caution.
