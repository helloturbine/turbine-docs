# 2023-11-23

## Forecasting
* Inventory Forecasting is now generally available. It is off by default. Please contact your account manager to have this turned on for you. 
* You can see your in-stock/out-of-stock info on the Stock page per SKU. 
* You can see your next action-by date on the Stock page as well. 

## BOMs
* Squashed a small bug that made it hard to add a BOM to a SKU that didn't have a name. 

## Nodes
* Location is now included on the Node index screen. No more guessing and checking. 

## Receipts
* Made a better experience on the receipt index screen to show you the PO Number you're used to seeing. 

## Vendor Experience
* On Vendors, you can now log MOQ information, as well as dig into a freeform notes section. This is another way we go even further in centralizing all of the information you need in one place. 
* We finally got consistent in the capitalization of "SKU" everywhere on this page. Sorry for any eye twitches we caused. 

## Work Orders
* You can now download a PDF to understand both what went into ta work order and all the BOMs associated with any items in the work order!

## Admin Tools
* Account Managers can now permanently delete accidentally created POs for you. Please provide feedback on this functionality to your point of contact directly. 
* Account Managers can now permanently delete accidentally created vendors for you. Please provide feedback on this functionality to your point of contact directly. 

## Integrations

### Anvyl
* We now get real-time events from Anvyl. You're welcome.
* We sometimes got weird dates from Anvyl. We don't think you're time traveling, so we're going to handle these for you.
