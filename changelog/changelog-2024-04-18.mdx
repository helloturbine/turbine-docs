# 2024-04-18

Important note: The Turbine team will be at a Company Offsite from Tuesday to Friday next week. **We will continued support coverage but responses may be delayed. Please bear with us!** 

## Inventory 
* We've filter out locations with 0 inventory in all categories from the location drop down to reduce clutter. 
* Fixed a bug that meant that sometimes the "Reorder By" column was hidden.

## Purchase Orders
* Based on feedback that it was confusing to have a PO with multiple locations, we've now consolidated POs to go to only one location. 
* If all line items on a PO/WO have a weight associated with them, you can now calculate landed costs by weight.

## Exceptions
* The Exceptions page now shows you the timestamp the exception was created for easier consumption _at a glance_.
* Improved the language on a couple of exceptions to make it clearer what is a problem

## End of Month Inventory Report
* Fixed an edge case that meant that if the month rolled over before the new EOM report existed, you'd get an error. D'oh!
* Improved how write offs are calculated and traceable with a new ledger type. 
* Consolidate received inventory across multiple receipt types into one receiving column
