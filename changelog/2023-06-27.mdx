# 2023-06-27

- We've upgraded the powers of the search box on the Purchase Order creation page. Now, you can search for components and SKUs all at once.
- Also, our component and SKU search support isn't just limited to the bulk upload of Purchase Orders. We've unleashed its full potential, allowing you to search like a pro when creating individual PO line items too!
- Our SKU search now displays the title of the SKU itself as you type. No more guessing games: confidently know what specific item you're ordering!
- Receipts and invoices can now be linked with specific purchase order line items. Follow a line item from when you order it to all the way to its arrival in your warehouse!
