# 2024-05-30 

## Purchase Orders

* We now standardized everywhere on a Purchase Order to use the Node Code, instead of sometimes using the name and sometimes the code. We love this kind of feedback. Keep it coming!

## Inventory Transfers

* We now show the associated receipt on the Inventory Transfer details page.
* We also link to the inventory transfer from the from Receipts Index and Detail pages.
* We filter out already received items from receipt creation page for Inventory Transfers.
* We show outbound order creation time and Turbine created at on the Inventory Transfer Detail page to help address any ambiguity.
