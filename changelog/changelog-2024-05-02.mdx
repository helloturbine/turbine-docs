# 2024-05-02

A quick changelog this week since we were offsite last week!

## Exceptions 
* We updated exceptions to make error messages clearer and more helpful. You can read more about them in the docs. 

## Integrations
* We now support unlimited Shopify stores in the UI. Just let us know if you need help setting up additional integrations. 

## Inventory Report
* We've updated the EOM report to show Product name in addition to SKU.

## Work Orders
* Items are no longer entered into inventory immediately at Work Order creation and only when items are received
