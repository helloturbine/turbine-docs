# 2024-01-10

## Happy New Year!

We're very excited to be coming in with our very first changelog update of the year. 
As you know, we make these changes available to our customers _as soon_ as we can, but it's always great to reflect on all the ways we've improved the app for you all. 

## Work orders
* Rather than showing the Turbine SKU in the create workflow, we now show the Remote SKU. 
* For consistency, SKU is now capitalized everywhere on this page. No more "Sku" making your eye twitch.
* See acknowledgement info on the work order details page. 

## Inventory
* Fixed a Bug affecting how Incoming Inventory Numbers were calculated

## Vendors
* You can now edit the lead time or Vendor SKU for a SKU on the Vendor directly.
* You can delete a Vendor SKU as long as it has not been used in the app anywhere.

## SKUs
* You can now edit the SKU description on a SKU details page. 
* Updated the PO information on the SKU details page to show quantity.

## Orders
* You can now filter orders by channel from the sidebar. 

## Other Improvements and Bug squashing
* We now have search enabled on this here docs site! Thanks to our firneds at Algolia!
* You can access "Settings" and "Inventory" via the Command Palette. CMD+K on a Mac or CTRL+K on a PC
* We now "remember" the PO that was selected when creating an invoice. We did, but now it's more obvious.
* The Receipt details now shows all the information about components that you'd expect it to show.
* For consistency, we updated the POs page to say PO Number in all the places it used to say Remote ID.
