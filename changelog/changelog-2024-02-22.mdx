# 2024-02-22

An important note: As mentioned in our last update, we are rolling out a *major* change to how exceptions work in Turbine so that they are significantly more useful. We appreciate all of your feedback on our Exception functionality. Should you find it confusing, please reach out to your account manager via Slack for support!


## Brand New
* New updates to the Nav Bar to make it more intutitive, including a new "Products" section and sneak peak of what's coming soon.
* Our all-new reports page! Read more in the docs directly. 

## Purchase Orders
* Purchase Order status is now visible on the PO Details sidebar. 

## Work Orders 
* Work Orders now require SKUs be assigned to the Vendor as a Vendor SKU in order to cut the WO. This change may be frustrating in the coming days, but will help improve the quality of the data drastically. 
* You can now see the BOM Details on a Work Order before submitting
* The Work Order details screen has been updated to use our Standard SKU Component to bring it's UI up to date.
* You can add Freight Shipment costs on Work Orders directly.
* Work Order status is now visible on the WO Details sidebar. 

## Nodes
* Node codes now must be unique. It's better that way.

## Inventory Page
* We've rolled out the new version of our Inventory, or Stock, page. Thanks for the feedback on helping us get to here!

## Exceptions
* We've added a new exception to support flagging Unacknowledged POs.
