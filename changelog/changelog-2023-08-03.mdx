# 2023-08-03

## Design
* We removed page descriptions in the navbar for a cleaner design (let's be real--you know what the inventory page is all about).
* We also moved user information to the top right corner to be less obtrusive.
* The 404 page now includes the navbar so you can get back to where you need to be, no GPS required.

## SKUs and Inventory
* Make your end-of-month inventory reporting a breeze. You can now generate and easily download monthly reports as a CSV.
* We've also added a SKU details page, where you can learn everything that there is to know about a product: barcode info, vendor information, the whole nine.

## Purchase Orders
* Give your inbox a break! You can now create a purchase order and schedule send a PDF version to your favorite vendor.
* We squashed a bug that only allowed prices to have two decimal places on POs. You can now have up to four--gotta love mathematical accuracy.
