# 2024-02-08

An important note: In the next week, we will be rolling out a *major* change to how exceptions work in Turbine so that they are significantly more useful. We appreciate all of your feedback on our Exception functionality. Should you find it confusing, please reach out to your account manager via Slack for support!

## Command Pallette

* Our Command Pallette has been expanded to include "New Work Order" and "New Purchase Order" directly. CMD + K and go forth!

## Components

* You can now edit the Remote SKU on a Component from the Component Details Page.

## Inventory

* Inventory for a given SKU is now available on the SKU Details screen. 

## Nodes

* The Node Name AND Company are available on the Node Index Screen. No more confusion!

## Receipts 

* When manually creating a receipt in Turbine, the receipt number will be autosuggested. 

## Vendors

* You can now see all POs related to a Vendor directly on the Vendors screen. Scroll to the bottom!

## Work Orders
* When a Work Order is sent via Turbine, the Vendor will also receive a follow up email to confirm the Work Order's completion.
* We are in the process of rolling out unit costs visibility on work orders. Numbers may be wonky in the interim.
