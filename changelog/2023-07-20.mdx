# 2023-07-20

A lot of work on purchase orders, lots of polishes, and the usual bug squashing and performance improvements. 

## Purchase Orders
* Did the PO get delivered exactly as expected? Right from the PO details screen, trigger a button to receive the PO in full. 
* Active POs now stand out with the active indicator on the PO index screen. At a glance, know which POs still have items outstanding.
* Download the PDF that we're going to send when you cut a PO from the PO screen.  

## Invoices
* We heard you. It's easier than ever to add and edit line items on an Invoice. 

## Login page
* The login page got a bit of a facelift. Polishes are so nice.

## Outbound Orders 
* It's now easier to see an order's status and channel at a glance with icons that make it easier to understand. 
* We added limits to how wide a table can be so that you don't have to scroll and scroll and scroll.

## Work orders
* See all of your work orders at a glance with our new work orders index page.
